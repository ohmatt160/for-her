      <p>Here are a few things I want to share about her:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Physical Appearance</li>
        <li>How I Met Her</li>
        <li>How We Started Talking</li>
        <li>Her Attitude</li>

      <button class="collapsible">Physical Appearance</button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          She’s a <em>cute</em> girl. A very cute one! I can't help the fact that she is very cute! Fair-skinned (I like
          fair girls!), slim, with a smile that makes her even more adorable, especially when she's shy.
        </p>

      <button class="collapsible">How I Met Her</button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>We started talking online on Facebook as casual friends. I think I eventually
          asked for her WhatsApp number and added her, but we didn’t talk much after that because she wasn’t
          often online. One day, out of the blue, she sent me a video of myself that my brother had posted on
          TikTok. She asked, 'Is this you?' I said yes, and she complimented the video, saying she liked it.
          Then, she called me on video, but all she did was smile without saying much – she was cute, though.
          After that call, we started chatting more regularly. At the time, I was in school, but when I got
          home, I made sure to go see her with some friends. It was after that first meet-up that our
          friendship really began to grow. My brother, friends, and I would go to her place at night to hang
          out and chat.</p>

      <button class="collapsible">How We Started Talking</button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          As I already mentioned — Facebook to WhatsApp to TikTok to calls to friendship.
        </p>

      <button class="collapsible">Her Attitude</button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          She doesn't have a bad attitude, though she can be dramatic sometimes!
